## Speech & Audio AI

### Speech to Text

- Wei, Kun, et al. "**Conversational speech recognition by learning audio-textual cross-modal contextual representation.**" IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing 32 (2024): 2432-2444. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14278)
  ```text
  Describes the limitations and challenges of ASR in conversational systems and presents a 
  novel ASR systems based on an attention-based Conformer architecture, Conditional VAE.
  ```
- Nozaki, Jumon, and Tatsuya Komatsu. "**Relaxing the conditional independence assumption of CTC-based ASR by conditioning on intermediate predictions.**" arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.02724 (2021). [paper](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2021/nozaki21_interspeech.pdf)
  ```text
  CTC-based ASR suffer from the "Conditional Independence Assumption", which affects its accuracy.
  This paper proposes intermediate prediction to relax the assumption problem.
  ```
- Watanabe, Shinji, et al. "**Hybrid CTC/attention architecture for end-to-end speech recognition.**" IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing 11.8 (2017): 1240-1253. [paper](https://merl.com/publications/docs/TR2017-190.pdf)
  ```text
  This paper discusses CTC & Transformer-based ASR architectures and proposes hybrid CTC/attention
  end-to-end ASR system for better accuracy and performance.

### Text to Speech

- Tan, Xu, et al. "**A survey on neural speech synthesis.**" arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.15561 (2021). [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15561)
  ```text
  Talks about history of text to speech, speech synthesis. Focuses mostly on
  TTS based on neural networks.
  ```
- Ren, Yi, et al. "**Fastspeech 2: Fast and high-quality end-to-end text to speech.**" arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.04558 (2020). [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04558v8)
  ```text
  Discusses rapid progress of TTS, describes limitations of autoregressive TTS models.
  Presents non-autoregressive TTS models as a solution.
